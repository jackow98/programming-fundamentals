#### Exercise 1: Basic Logical Operators

1. **Exercise 1.1**

   - **Question:** Assign values to variables representing the temperature and whether it is sunny. Write a Python program to check if the temperature is greater than 15 and it is sunny. Print the result. [1]
   - **Instructions:**

     ```python
     # Assign values to variables
     temperature = 20
     is_sunny = True

     # Write a logical expression to check the conditions
     # Print the result
     ```

2. **Exercise 1.2**

   - **Question:** Assign values to variables representing the temperature and whether it is raining. Write a Python program to check if the temperature is greater than 15 or it is raining. Print the result. [2]
   - **Instructions:**

     ```python
     # Assign values to variables
     temperature = 10
     is_raining = False

     # Write a logical expression to check the conditions
     # Print the result
     ```

3. **Exercise 1.3**

   - **Question:** Assign a value to a variable representing the number of apples. Write a Python program to check if the number of apples is not greater than 10. Print the result. [2]
   - **Instructions:**

     ```python
     # Assign a value to the variable
     number_of_apples = 8

     # Write a logical expression to check the condition
     # Print the result
     ```

#### Exercise 2: Precedence of Logical Operators

1. **Exercise 2.1**

   - **Question:** Assign values to variables representing the age of a person and whether they have a driving licence. Write a Python program to check if the person is older than 18 and has a driving licence. Print the result. [2]
   - **Instructions:**

     ```python
     # Assign values to variables
     age = 20
     has_licence = True

     # Write a logical expression to check the conditions
     # Print the result
     ```

2. **Exercise 2.2**

   - **Question:** Assign values to variables representing the speed of a car and whether it is raining. Write a Python program to check if the speed is greater than 60 or it is not raining. Print the result. [2]
   - **Instructions:**

     ```python
     # Assign values to variables
     speed = 55
     is_raining = False

     # Write a logical expression to check the conditions
     # Print the result
     ```

3. **Exercise 2.3**

   - **Question:** Assign values to variables representing the number of hours studied and whether the student feels prepared. Write a Python program to check if the number of hours studied is greater than 5 or the student feels prepared. Use parentheses to ensure that the 'or' condition is evaluated first. Print the result. [2]
   - **Instructions:**

     ```python
     # Assign values to variables
     hours_studied = 4
     feels_prepared = True

     # Write a logical expression to check the conditions with parentheses
     # Print the result
     ```

#### Exercise 3: Complex Logical Expressions

1. **Exercise 3.1**

   - **Question:** Assign values to variables representing the number of assignments completed and the number of assignments pending. Write a Python program to check if the number of assignments completed is greater than 5 and the number of assignments pending is less than 2. Print the result. [2]
   - **Instructions:**

     ```python
     # Assign values to variables
     assignments_completed = 6
     assignments_pending = 1

     # Write a logical expression to check the conditions
     # Print the result
     ```

2. **Exercise 3.2**

   - **Question:** Assign values to variables representing the amount of savings and the price of a desired item. Write a Python program to check if the amount of savings is greater than the price of the item or if the item is on sale. Print the result. [3]
   - **Instructions:**

     ```python
     # Assign values to variables
     savings = 100
     item_price = 150
     item_on_sale = True

     # Write a logical expression to check the conditions
     # Print the result
     ```

3. **Exercise 3.3**

   - **Question:** Assign values to variables representing the weather condition (sunny or not) and the day of the week (weekend or not). Write a Python program to check if it is sunny and it is the weekend or if it is not sunny and it is a weekday. Print the result. [3]
   - **Instructions:**

     ```python
     # Assign values to variables
     is_sunny = True
     is_weekend = False

     # Write a logical expression to check the conditions
     # Print the result
     ```
