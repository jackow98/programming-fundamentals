# Activity - Conditional Loops
**18 marks**

## Instructions
After reviewing the notes in OneNote, write a Python program to accomplish the task described for each question.

### 1. Write a Python program to keep asking for a code until it equals "rzy" and print "Code accepted" once the user enters "rzy".

Note: A conditional loop in Python can be used as shown below:
```python
while code != "tx5":
    code = input("Please re-enter code")
print("Code accepted")
```
**Marks: 1**

### 2. Write a Python program to keep asking for a code until it equals 4003 and print "Code accepted" when the code is correct.

Hint:
```python
code = int(input("Enter code"))  # Note: To turn an inputted string into an integer
```
**Marks: 2**

### 3. Write a Python program to keep asking for the user's age until it is over 14 and print "Age accepted" once the user enters an age over 14.

Key Concepts to Remember:
- > Greater than
- < Less than
- >= Greater than or equal to
- <= Less than or equal to
- == Equal to
- != Not equal to

**Marks: 3**

### 4. Write a Python program to keep asking the user to input a password until it is longer than 5 characters and print "Password accepted" once the password is longer than 5 characters.

Instructions:
```python
name = input("Enter name:")
lengthName = len(name)  # Note: To find the length of a string in Python. For example, "Sam" would output 3
print(lengthName)
```
**Marks: 3**

### 5. Write a Python program to ask the user if they would like to watch another episode of Modern Family. If they enter the word "yes," then print "playing another episode" and repeat. Otherwise, print "See you later!" and stop.

Template:
```python
playAnother = input("Would you like to play another episode?")
while ___________ == "yes":
    ____________________
    ____________________
____________________
# Note: We need to keep looping if the user enters yes
```
**Marks: 4**

### 6. Write a Python program to keep asking for money until the total amount of money is greater than 100. Print "I accept your offer" once the total money is greater than 100.

Template:
```python
totalMoney = 0
money = input("How much you got?")
totalMoney = totalMoney + money # Note: We need to keep a track of the total amount of money the user offers
